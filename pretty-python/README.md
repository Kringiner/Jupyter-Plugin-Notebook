Pretty  python
=========
To use the extension, do three simple things:
1) Run this command to install Jupyter nbextensions

    `pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions && jupyter contrib nbextension install`

2) Run this command to search directory with nbextensions:

    `pip show jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`
   
3) Move directory `pretty-python` to directory with nbextensions

Done! It remains only to connect it already in Jupyter.
